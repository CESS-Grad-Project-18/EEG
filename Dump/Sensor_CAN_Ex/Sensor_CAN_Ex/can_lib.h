//  @fn can_init

//! timing, initialize all the registers mapped in SRAM to put MObs in
//! inactive state and enable the CAN macro.

//!          level as long as of an inter frame (hardware feature).
//!
//! @param  Mode (for "can_fixed_baudrate" param not used)

//  @fn can_cmd
//!
//! This function takes a CAN descriptor, analyses the action to do:
//! transmit, receive or abort.
//! This function returns a status (CAN_CMD_ACCEPTED or CAN_CMD_REFUSED) if
//! a MOb for Rx or Tx has been found. If no MOB has been found, the
//! application must be retry at a later date.
//! This function also updates the CAN descriptor status (MOB_PENDING or
//! MOB_NOT_REACHED) if a MOb for Rx or Tx has been found. If aborting
//! is performed, the CAN descriptor status will be set to STATUS_CLEARED.
//!
//! @param  st_cmd_t* - Can_descriptor pointer on CAN descriptor structure
//!         to select the action to do.
//!
//! @return CAN_CMD_ACCEPTED - command is accepted
//!         CAN_CMD_REFUSED  - command is refused

//! This function also updates the CAN descriptor status (MOB_TX_COMPLETED,
