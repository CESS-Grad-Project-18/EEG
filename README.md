| Features | <ul><li>Slowest and highest amplitude brainwaves.</li></ul><ul><li>Only present during dreamless sleep (NREM).</li></ul><ul><li>Stronger in the right brain hemisphere.</li></ul><ul><li>Localized in the thalamus.</li></ul><ul><li>Formation and internal arrangement of biographic memory as well as acquired skills and learned information.</li></ul> | <ul><li>Correlate with the difficulty of mental operations</li></ul><ul><li>Stand out as task becomes harder.</li></ul><ul><li>Serves as carrier frequency for cognitive (learning) processing across brain regions that are further apart</li></ul> | <ul><li>High power during mental and physical relaxation with eyes closed and vice versa.</li></ul><ul><li>Alpha suppression indicates that the brain is getting ready to collect information from various senses, coordinating attentional resources and focusing on what is considered relevent/important in a paticular moment.</li></ul> | <ul><li>High power during movement execution, particularly when fine finger movements is required (such as reaching out or grasping) and focused attention.</li></ul><ul><li>High power during noticing other people's body movement (Mimicing others).</li></ul> | <ul><li>Serves as a carrier frequency for binding various sensory impressions of an object together (Attention).</li></ul><ul><li>By-product of other neural processes such as eye movements and microsaccades (بترف).</li></ul> |
